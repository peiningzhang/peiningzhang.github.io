I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the
[Computer Science and Engineering department](https://www.cse.uconn.edu/) of the University of Connecticut, advised by
[Prof. Jinbo Bi](https://www.cse.uconn.edu/person/jinbo-bi/).

From 2021 to 2023, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at
[Kuaishou Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuaishou) in the group of personalized ads marketing.

Before that, I obtained a master's degree of science in computer science from Rutgers University in 2021.
I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by
[Prof. Linli Xu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~linlixu/index.html).

Throughout my bachelor's and master's time, my research lay in generative models in NLP.
Then in my work, I gained practical experience in data mining and recommendation systems.

Currently, my research focus is on 3D generative models and drug discovery.
